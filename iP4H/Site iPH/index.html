				<h3>What is iPH? </h3>

				<p>The Interactive Presenter for Handhelds (iPH)  is a distributed application which supports sharing and co-edition os  slide presentations, and which runs on both Windows XP and Windows  Mobile.</p>

		        <p>It requires one of the participants to assume the  role of an instructor (or moderator). The instructor is the one who  controls the presentation, showing each one of the slides, and asking  the other participants to give a written, or drawn, contribution at  particular points of the presentation. For example, the instructor may  present a slide with a question that is to be answered by all  participants. The iPH supports input both in form of digital ink or  typed text, that are printed over the image of a slide.</p>

		        <p>It  can be used for any PowerPoint presentation. However, before the  presentation can be displayed and shared through the tool, it has to be  converted by a support tool named iDeck. This tool processes a batch of  PowerPoint slides and converts them to JPEG images and links them  appropriately. Hence, the presentation's animations are not preserved  during this conversion.</p>

		        <p>The iPH comes in the XP and Mobile  versions, of which the most notable difference is the graphical user  interface (GUI). In the XP version it is possible to simultaneously  display the thumbnail-view and the slide-view. In the Mobile version,  this views are split into two different screens. Due to the special  form and the limited size of the handheld display, some of the buttons  are also placed at different positions. </p>

		        <p>Moreover, iPH  supports the dynamic activation/de-activation of some of its functions  at any moment. In this case, the corresponding button (or option) on  the GUI appears in gray or becomes invisible. This may be useful in  three cases: (a) if the functionality of iPH needs to be shaped  according to the availability of the local resources, e.g. little  amount of remaining energy or memory, which is particularly common for  handhelds, or (b) if the ability of a participant to interact and  contribute should be constrained by the current quality of the wireless  ink, her/his location, or other context information, and (c) if the  participant's interaction capabilities are to be individually and  remotely controlled by the instructor.</p>

		        <p>With this feature,  iPH can be easily integrated with any context-provision middleware,  allowing a wide range of possibilities to become context-aware. In our  case, we integrate with our middleware MoCA, wich provides information  regarding the execution context, and a user's symbolic location. </p>

				<h3>Implementation</h3>

				<p>The iPH system is built on the top of Compact Conference XP (CCXP),  which is port of ConferenceXP framework to .NET Compact Framework (CF).  The ConferenceXP platform is a middleware for multipoint communication  and synchronization that enables researches to create distributed  applications that take advantage of ConferenceXP technology as well as  Tablet PCsand wireless networks while enabling them to develop  collaborative tools and applications without having to deal with low  level communication and conectivity control.</p>

				<h3>Development</h3>

				<p>iPH has been developed in the <a href="https://mwlab.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/ActiveClassroom">Active Classroom   Project</a>, partially funded by	<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a>. </p>
