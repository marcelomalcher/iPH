File: Identity.cs
1. Removed reference to MessengerAPI. Then, there is no way to get the identifier from Messenger.

2. Removed reference to Windows Authentication. There is no way to get the identifier from Windows at WinCE.

3. Removed reference to config file, GetIdentifierFromMessenger and GetIdentifierFromWindows. 

4. Verify this. When identifier is not set, what should be returned?
   > return "Unknown";
